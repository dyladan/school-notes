    ;you are probably asking yourself why we bother wrapping
    ;up all our values as "expressed values". The reasons are
    ;twofold; a pragmatic reason is that by always using the extractors
    ;of the expressed values in the implementation of your code
    ;you automatically do dynamic type checking. When writing the code
    ;try imagining how it would look like if you wouldn't let the
    ;extractors throw the type errors.
    
    ;Second, if we tie our implementation to the defining language's
    ;(in this case racket) values instead of an interface you might
    ;run into portability issues. You might observe that the interface
    ;we are using is also written in racket, so why would it matter?
    ;Because defining an interface in a language can make it easier
    ;to define a bridging interface between two different languages.
    ;although we will not get into that.
