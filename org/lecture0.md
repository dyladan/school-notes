  - Double word = 2 words

## Assembly Language

```
ADD X1, X2, X3 // X1 <= X2 + X3
```

A[12] = h + A[8]; // Using double words

```
// Value of h => X21
// Address of A => X22

LDUR X9,[X22,#64] // load 64 bits of data starting at A[8] into X9
ADD X9,X21,X9 // X9 += X21
STUR X9,[X22,#96] // Store X9 to 96/8=12th element of A
```
