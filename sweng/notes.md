# Software Development Practice

## Software Development Methods
- Waterfall
- Iterative + Incremental
- Agile

## Software Design Process

### Requirements

What does the program need to do?

### Analysis

What is a system objective?

What are the system objects?

- Gameboard
  - Keyboard
  - Characters
  - Button
- Word

### Design

Gameboard owns buttons, and label

### Implementation

### Delivery

## Agile

## Synchronize and Stabilize Model

- Microsoft's lifecycle model

Everybody checks code in at the end of the day (synchronize). At the end of the
build you freeze code (stabilize).

## Spiral Model

- If all risks cannot be mitigated, the project is immediately terminated
- If you are unsure if a risk is high or low, assume high

Preceed each phase by risk analysis Follow each phase by evaluation and
planning

## Comparison of life cycle models

- Criteria for deciding
  - Organization
  - Management
  - Skill of employees
  - Nature of the product

## Open source life cycle model

1. An individual builds an initial version
2. Enthusiasts and users download, use, and modify the project
  - Reporting issues and bugs
  - Adding functionality
  - Porting

- Typically strongly moderated in order to guard against sub-par code or ideas.
- Users generally only work on features that are important to them, which means
  the features that receive attention are the features that are useful to
  people who actually use the software
- Open source projects typically enforce a strict coding style

# Software Measurement

- Meaure project for budgeting and scheduling
- Measure product for quality and performance
- Measure process for efficiency and effectiveness

## Formal hedge pruning
